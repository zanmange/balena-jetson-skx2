        After the latest updates, some services
        and scripts seem to no longer be necessary.

        Removing them so brcm_patcram_plus is no
        longer taking up CPU, hci0 timeouts warnings
        are no longer present. hcitool scan works.

        Tested with devkit, spacely and orrbity
        carrier boards.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset

                which it probably should.

                We load the hello-world image after starting the balena daemon.

                chaining a

                15 second sleep for good measure.


                We load the hello-world image here so that devices out in the

                on prem devices don't need to pull from dockerhub which would

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

    - subject: Patches for TCP-based remote denial of service vulnerabilities
      hash: 298c68fac353f073977c17adc4a7ee4bf2b1e233
      body: >
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

        These files are brought in from the Ubuntu demo image
        provided by NVidia but are modified for our usecases.

        We don't execute the bluetooth scripts from the udev
        rule, instead we invoke them from the nvbtwifi* service
        files. Also it is important to bring device up before
        BlueZ gets the chance to interfere with it to avoid
        intermittent failures.

                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.

              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and
                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs
                can

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly.
                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

        Customers compiling out of tree kernel modules related to video camera
        will require headers from drivers/media/platform/tegra/camera.
        Also, customers building out of tree modules might also make use of
        dma-iommu.h and hypervisor.h and on the Jetson TX2 kernel
        (which is 64 bits) these header files actually include their 32 bits
        counterparts so let's add those too.

              hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
              body: >
                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                Since thud, this patch is included by default so this change

                it on all the rest of the supported mate-balena yocto version
                specific

                Add a OS_KERNEL_CMDLINE parameter that allows BSPs to easily add

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                The partition numbers are hex and not integers. This is obvious
                when

                using the jetson family of devices as their partition numbering
                starts

                at 0xc.


                - Change integer comparisons to string comparisons.

                - Convert current_part_idx to hex for a valid string comparison

                From u-boot docs:

                "Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in
                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when
                this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the
                data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to

                errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using
                Yoctos

                QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to
                manually

                map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86


                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

              hash: 69d2340ccf5691085bebeb92478475cd3278bbb9
              body: >
                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {
                      "randomMacAddressScan": false
                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.


                Fixes #1294

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional
                file

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

      hash: 752076bfe8ee1a2cda6e9407fb36b95105e064af
      body: |
        The device tree for the n510-tx2 machine seems to be loaded
        by the first stage bootloader program(before u-boot) on the
        jetson-tx2 instead of the jetson-tx2 device tree.
        This patch installs the n510-tx2 device tree only when the machine
        is built.

                the OS name which is part of the distro name. This ends up in
                the

                dashboard as part of the OS version.

        We pin the skx2 to kernel version 4.4.38 (which is the version
        from l4t 28.1) because later kernel versions introduced in l4t
        28.2 produce EMI issues for this board.

                Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working
                with rust 1.24.1 (for sumo)
              hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.
